Maze Specs
- Two red dots, start and end points
- Blue Outline fully enveloping both Red Dots
- Solid Blue Lines for each Wall to avoid confusion of gap
- None of the surface paper is on should be visible

Each maze will have it's own manually tuned threshhold for b/w and start or stop.
Common errors:
- BW threshold too high: Too much black and may interfere with the path by blocking the only viable path or covering the start/end nodes
- BW threshold too low: everything goes white and there become holes that shouldn't be there so invalid solution
- _const too low: random bits of white might be seen as boundaries or start/end points making solutions impossible
- _const too high: difficult to find start/stop points or sides that are fainter. Means potentially walls arent noticed which increases area checked.
